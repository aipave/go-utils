## Partitioning strategy in kafka 

In Kafka, the partitioning strategy determines how messages are distributed across the partitions of a topic. The
partitioning strategy is important because it affects the performance and scalability of the Kafka cluster, and can also
impact the ordering and reliability of messages.

Kafka provides several built-in partitioning strategies that can be used to distribute messages across the partitions of
a topic:

Round-robin partitioning: In this strategy, messages are distributed across partitions in a round-robin fashion, so that
each partition receives an equal number of messages.

Hash-based partitioning: In this strategy, a hash function is applied to the message key (if available) to determine the
partition to which the message is sent. This ensures that messages with the same key are always sent to the same
partition, which can be useful for maintaining message ordering or grouping related messages together.

Range-based partitioning: In this strategy, partitions are assigned ranges of keys, and messages are sent to the
partition whose range includes the message key. This can be useful for applications that require message keys to be
ordered, as messages with adjacent keys will be sent to adjacent partitions.

Custom partitioning: Kafka also allows you to define your own custom partitioning strategy by implementing the
org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Partitioner interface. This can be useful for more advanced use cases where none of
the built-in partitioning strategies are sufficient.

When choosing a partitioning strategy, it is important to consider factors such as message ordering requirements, key
distribution, and cluster scalability. Different strategies may be more appropriate for different use cases, and it may
be necessary to experiment with different strategies to determine the best one for your application.
